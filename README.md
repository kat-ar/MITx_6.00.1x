# MITx_6.00.1x
My programs from edX course ,,Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python''. I took the course without certification, just to refresh the programmistic knowledge I gained during studying maths and cog-sci.

It helped me reassure myself I like to think algorithmically. 

What I learned from this course is object-oriented programming. It is not my favourite approach in terms of what is a natural way of coding for me, but it is a great way to stretch my concept of what is possible and how to do things.
