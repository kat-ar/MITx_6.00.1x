# MITx_6.00.1x
My programs from edX course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python". I took the course without certification, just to refresh my programistic knowledge gained during studying maths and cog-sci.

It helped me reassure myself I like to think algorithmically. 

What I learned from this course is object-oriented programming. I did not understand it very well before and wasn't a fan therefore. This course changed it!
